# Preemptive Scheduling of Emergency Vehicles for Road Safety

This project aims to enhance road safety by preemptively scheduling traffic signals to clear the path for emergency vehicles. It utilizes OpenCV technology for real-time video analysis to detect the presence of emergency vehicles in camera footage. Additionally, GPS technology is used to track the real-time location of emergency vehicles, allowing for automatic switching of traffic signals along their route, thereby minimizing response time.
## Simulation
To visualize the functionality of the project, we have created a simulation. You can access the simulation [here](https://atharvakolekar.github.io/SmartTrafficOptimization/simulation/).
